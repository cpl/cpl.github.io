Here have a nice XKCD that I like,
this is your reward for looking here

https://www.xkcd.com/676/

Passionate Software Developer and hobbyists System Engineer. Iâ€™ve spent most of my first year at university attending hackathons and doing crazy projects.

Critical on the state of "web" and new fad emerging technologies. Wishing more developers would understand that _less is more_.

My main programming languages are: **C**, **Go**, **ARM ASM** and I am a wizard of **Git**, **Regex**, and **System design**.
I am always looking to learn or contribute to something new.

My IDE of choice is **VSCode** or **InteliJ** with a nice, dark, cold theme. If I have to work remotely over `ssh` I can **Vim** my way around.

While technology and tinkering are passions of mine and working in this area brings me joy & pride, I also like hiking, cooking, board games, traveling and listening to Pink Floyd while doing any of the above.
